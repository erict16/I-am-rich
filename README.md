This iOS app is a simple project created for fun and as a learning experience. It represents my first attempt at developing an iOS app. The app consists of two main features: a sign-in button and a placeholder function.

## 🔮 Features
Sign-In Button
The app includes a sign-in button that triggers an action when tapped. The action associated with the button can be customized to suit your needs. In the provided code, the action simply prints a message to the console.

## 🦀 Placeholder Function
In addition to the sign-in button, the app also includes a placeholder function. This function can be modified and expanded upon to add more functionality to the app as desired. Currently, it serves as an example of how additional features can be implemented.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the app, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository.
Open the Xcode project file in Xcode.
Build and run the project on a simulator or device.
Explore the app's sign-in button and placeholder function.
